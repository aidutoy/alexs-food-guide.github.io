                    I am one of those people who spend the first few minutes of every meal taking pictures of the plate in front of me. Not everyone is a fan of this but I don't do it for them. I do it for myself to remember. However, I thought what good does this photo do stuck in my phone. Why not share my experiences with you? Thats what I think food is all about, sharing with friends and family. Now I am not a food critic so I cannot go into detail about every spice, nor do I want to. I want to keep it simple and highlight the key points I would ask, what's on the menu, how much does it cost, what do you recommend, and can I eat there if I have some dietary restrictions? So I hope you enjoy this small presentation of my experiences, if you have any comments please don't hestitate to ask!
